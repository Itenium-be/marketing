Itenium didn't flinch when I requested a dream job, a well paid challenge with modern technology and minimal commute time.
Being true-bred software developers themselves, they can instinctively sense what's a good opportunity and what's not.

They delivered insight into the job market, offered choice and advice based on experience, and always paid on time.
What more can you expect, in a business of faceless middlemen, this was truly an honest and hands-on approach.

Itenium helped me launch my career to the next level, thanks guys!
