Candidate CV Parser Issues
==========================

# Common problems

**Mobile number**:  

- Not always recognized. Always check if it is filled in as this is obviously a very important field!
- If the number was not prefixed with +32, Bullhorn adds +31 automatically. This is usually NOT correct!


# Manual fields


- **Title**: Do not forget to change this for female candidates
- **Start year IT career**
- **Date of birth**
- **Employment Preference**
- **Desired Locations**: If provided by the consultant (often a freelancer gives an indication in the email with his CV)
- **Notice Period / Date Available / Recontact Date**
- **Source**: To make sure we don't accidently violate the terms of a contract, always fill in this field.
- **LinkedIn Url**
- **Current / Desired Rate**: Can also often be found in the email with the CV
- **Job Categories**: Not always filled in automatically
- **Languages**


## Remove / Add other fields?

- Will we keep track of "Start year (relevant) IT career"? Perhaps this is only relevant for potential payroll consultants?

Any other fields that might not be worth the effort?


# Things to decide upon

Biggest issue here is that we need to define a single flow and set of statusses that will work for both payroll consultants and freelancers.

## Statusses

Current statusses: Pre-Registered, Available, Placed By Us, DO NO USE, Archived

We need to decide upon these statusses. These options do not make much sense for us I think?

## Flow steps

Current flow: Prescreen > Shortlist > CV Sent > Interview > Offer Extended > Placement

We should also configure this to something that makes sense for us.
Same difficulty here that we have payroll candidates and freelance candidates.
